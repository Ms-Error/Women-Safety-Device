## Description
Though we are living in the 21st century, people are facing lots of problems such as poverty, pollution, corruption, illiteracy, and women's safety. Due to the increase in the crime rate, women are feeling insecure to step out of the house. Most women may not achieve their dreams because of these reasons. With the help of technology, why can't we make a women's safety device?

The motivation behind this project is to make women feel that they are secure in all conditions. This device will generate an emergency alarm, will send the message, and also the SOS call to the concerned person. Women carrying this device can send the information to the police by pressing the SOS button
